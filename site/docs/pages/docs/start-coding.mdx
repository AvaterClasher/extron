# Coding in Extron

## Overview

Lets start with a very simple program in Extron to get the feel of the language.

``` ts [example.ext]
let i = 0;

set i = 3;

print(i);

Console // [!code ++]
3 // [!code ++]
```

As we can see here for initializing a variable we use `let` keyword and for assigning a value to a variable again we can use `set` keyword. `print` is used to print the value of a variable.
To learn more about the keywords refer [here](/docs/concepts/Syntax).

## How to run the code

1. Make a new file with `.ext` extension in your editor. 
2. Write the code in the file.
3. If the extron package is available in your system then you can run the code by using the command `extron run <filename>.ext` in the terminal.
4. Or else if it is available in the directory your working on then you can run the code by using the command `./extron run <filename>.ext` in the terminal.
