# Getting Started

## Overview

Extron is a simple interpreter written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org).

You can write files for extron in its REPL (Read-Eval-Print-Loop) or in a file with the `.ext` extension.

## Installation

### For installing in Linux

Just run this [script](https://github.com/AvaterClasher/extron/blob/main/install.sh).

```bash
sh install.sh
```

### For installing in Windows

Download the latest version of Extron from [here](https://github.com/AvaterClasher/extron/releases/download/latest/extron.exe).

Then edit your system's `PATH` variable and add: 
`your-path-here` means the folder where the extron.exe is stored.
Do not add the `/extron.exe` like this inside the path.

`{your-path-here}`

See [this guide on editing the system `PATH`](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/path.html)
from the Java documentation.
