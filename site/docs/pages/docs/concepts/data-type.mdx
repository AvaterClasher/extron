# Data Types

Extron has a lot of data types that can be used to store and manipulate data. Here are some of the data types that Extron supports:

- `String` - A sequence of characters.
- `Number` - A numeric data type.
    - `Integer`
    - `Float`
- `Boolean` - A data type that can have one of two values: `true` or `false`.
- `Array` - A collection of elements.

## Data types with examples

::::steps

### String

- They are a sequence of characters.
- They can be created by enclosing characters in double quotes.

```ts
let name = "Extron";
```

### Number

- Numbers are either Integers or Floating point numbers.
    - `Integers` are whole numbers.
    - `Floating point numbers` are numbers with a decimal point.

```ts
let int = 12;
let float = 12.5;
print ( int + float );

Console // [!code ++]
24.5 // [!code ++]
```

### Boolean

- Booleans are a data type that can have one of two values: `true` or `false`.

```ts
print ( 2 > 5 );

Console // [!code ++]
false // [!code ++]
```

### Array

- Arrays are a collection of elements.
- They can store elements of any data type.
- They can be created by enclosing elements in square brackets.
- Arrays can be indexed by their position in the array.
    - Arrays are `0-indexed`.

```ts
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
print ( arr[2] );

set arr = [ "Extron", 12, true ];
print ( arr[0] );

Console // [!code ++]
3 // [!code ++]
Extron // [!code ++]
```
