# Operators

`Operators` is a symbol which is used to perform operations on variables and values. For example, `+` is an operator used to perform addition. It tells the compiler to perform the addition of two numbers.

## Arithmetic Operators

::::steps

### Addition Operator

- The `+` operator is used to add two numbers.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let c = a + b;
print(c);

Console // [!code ++]
30 // [!code ++]
```

### Subtraction Operator

- The `-` operator is used to subtract two numbers.

```ts
let a = 20;
let b = 10;
let c = a - b;
print(c);

Console // [!code ++]
10 // [!code ++]
```

### Multiplication Operator

- The `*` operator is used to multiply two numbers.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
let c = a * b;
print(c);

Console // [!code ++]
200 // [!code ++]
```

### Division Operator

- The `/` operator is used to divide two numbers.

```ts
let a = 20;
let b = 10;
let c = a / b;
print(c);

Console // [!code ++]
2 // [!code ++]
```

## Logical Operators

### Equality Operator

- The `==` operator is used to check if two values are equal.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 10;
print(a == b);

Console // [!code ++]
true // [!code ++]
```

### Inequality Operator

- The `!=` operator is used to check if two values are not equal.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
print(a != b);

Console // [!code ++]
true // [!code ++]
```

### Less/Greater Than Operator

- The `<` and `>` operators are used to check if a value is less than or greater than another value.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
print(a < b);
print(a > b);

Console // [!code ++]
true // [!code ++]
false // [!code ++]
```

### Less/Greater Than or Equal Operator

- The `<=` and `>=` operators are used to check if a value is less than or equal to or greater than or equal to another value.

```ts
let a = 10;
let b = 20;
print(a <= b);
print(a >= b);

Console // [!code ++]
true // [!code ++]
false // [!code ++]
```
